Assignment 2 Question 1
1)Explain which distance metric performed better and why, referencing KNN’s sensitivity to outliers (Page 18) and the Iris dataset’s characteristics.
It works better as the data is continious and properly seperated data. Manhattan is more affected in those places where there is a lot of overlapping, thus small errors can reduce its accuracy.

2)Suggest one preprocessing step (e.g., scaling) to improve KNN performance and justify it.
We can use minmax scalar to put all features in the 0,1 range so there is no dominating feaure(reduction in error during calculation).
