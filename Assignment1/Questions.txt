ASSIGNMENT - 1

(Q1) Titanic Data Exploration & Transformation
Objective: Apply your knowledge of NumPy and Pandas to perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and basic exploration on a real-world dataset.
Instructions:
Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle Titanic Dataset or use any .csv version of it available online.
Using Pandas, complete the following tasks:

 A. Data Loading and Exploration


Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
Display the first 5 rows.
Print the shape and column names.
Check for missing values in each column.


B. Data Cleaning


Fill missing Age values with the mean age using NumPy.
Fill missing Embarked values with the most frequent value.
Drop the Cabin column from the dataset.


C. Feature Engineering


Create a new column FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1.
Convert the Sex column to numerical format using a map.
Extract the title (e.g., Mr, Mrs, Miss) from the Name column using string methods.
Create a binary column IsMinor where age < 18 is 1, else 0.


D. NumPy Practice


Use NumPy to calculate:
Average fare for passengers who survived vs. those who didn’t.
Standard deviation of age.
Number of passengers with age between 20 and 40 (inclusive).


E. Analysis


Group the dataset by Pclass and calculate the average survival rate.
Find the top 3 names of passengers who paid the highest fares.
Save the Cleaned data with an appropriate name

(Q2) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sIoTv8cqQhlglIHPcV7etW5AqSym1FjXKCndg7jt9aw/edit?usp=sharing

You are given a dataset student_data.csv which contains the following columns:

hours_studied (float): Number of hours a student studied.

attendance (float): Percentage of attendance.

passed (0/1): Whether the student passed the exam (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

score (float): Final exam score (0-100).


Tasks:

1. Linear Regression
a. Build a linear regression model to predict the score of a student based on hours_studied and attendance.
b. Evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.


2. Logistic Regression
a. Build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student passed the exam based on hours_studied and attendance.
b. Evaluate the model using Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.


3. Report
a. Compare the performance of both models.
b. Explain which features influenced the outcome the most.
c. Discuss any limitations of your models and suggest improvements.
