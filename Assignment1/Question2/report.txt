a. Compare the performance of both models
Linear Regression (predicting score)
Very strong performance: R² ≈ 0.96 → explains ~96% of the variation in exam scores.
Errors are small: MAE ≈ 3, MSE ≈ 18, which means predicted scores are within close proximity from average(~3 marks).
Logistic Regression (predicting passed)
Perfect results on the small test set: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 = 1.0.
Confusion Matrix showed all pass/fail outcomes correctly classified.
Due tot he small size of the dataset the accuracy is very hard to exactly predict
TheLinear Regression gives score predictions, while Logistic Regression is providing us categorical pass/fail classification.

b. Features influencing the outcome
hours_studied: larger coefficient which indicates a very strong influence on exam score.
attendance: positive influence, but weaker compared to hours studied.
Interpretation: more study hours directly raise predicted scores; attendance contributes but is secondary.
Logistic Regression coefficients
Same pattern: hours_studied has higher weight → more study hours drastically increase probability of passing.
attendance improves odds of passing, but with less impact.
In both the models we can see that hours studied is the most important feature, with attendance being supportive.

c. Limitations & improvements
Limitations
Dataset is very small (20 rows) → models likely overfit and may not generalize to unseen data.
Only two features (hours, attendance) are considered; real-world exam performance depends on more (study quality, prior knowledge, health, stress).
Logistic Regression showed perfect scores, but that’s likely due to dataset size → not reliable in practice.
Improvements
Collect more data (hundreds+ students) for robust generalization.
Add more features (sleep hours, previous grades, assignments, etc.).
Use cross-validation instead of a single train-test split to better estimate performance.
