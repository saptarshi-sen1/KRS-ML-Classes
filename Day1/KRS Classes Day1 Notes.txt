Boxplot


Correlation matrix
We are taking the intensity of relation between the 2 datapts. It is used to check the intensity of relation
There are 3 case
+1.Perfect positive correlation
0.No correlation
-1.Perfect negative correlation

The correlation of a feature with the same one will always be 1

annot = true
dpi= the sharpness of the graph or the plot
linewidth pt=border beside the grids to differentiate between the 2 cells

Confusion matrix
It is used to see the relation between the confusion matrix and the actual result that it has happened
